# Methods

	Finding a comprehensive dataset that had consistent measurements of benthic or littoral conditions as well as nutrient data and a wide-spread spatial reach proved to be much more difficult than anticipated. The National Lakes Assessment dataset was selected for the data analysis included in this project. This dataset includes hundreds of metrics sampled at thousands of lakes around the United States in 2007, 2012 and 2017 including physical, chemical, and hydrological parameters. The data is all publicly available for download on their website and sampling methodologies are outlined for the convenience of the researcher. 
	Zip files and CSV files were downloaded from the data portal and imported into R Studio for data analysis. A significant amount of time was spent data cleaning and formatting in order to prepare for statistical testing and visualization. Both learning and troubleshooting code for the entirety of this project were core to the success of the research and the understanding of the results.

	
	Importing and Organizing All Data Frames
```{r, 3-1}
basin_lu_metrics_07 <- read_csv("data/nla2007_alldata (1)/NLA2007_Basin_Landuse_Metrics_20061022.csv")

site_id_conversion <- read_csv("data/site_id_conversion.csv")

chem_conditions_07 <- read_csv("data/nla2007_alldata (1)/NLA2007_Chemical_ConditionEstimates_20091123.csv")

phab_metrics_07_a <- read_csv("data/nla2007_alldata (1)/NLA2007_PHab_Metrics_A.csv")

water_quality_07 <- site_merger(df = water_quality_07, year = "2007")

site_merger <- function(df = phab_12, year = '2012'){
  site_same <- site_id_conversion %>%
    select(SITE_ID = year,
           UNIQUE_ID)
  
  uniquely_identified <- inner_join(df,site_same, 
                                    multiple = 'all')
}
chem_conditions_07 <- site_merger(df = chem_conditions_07, year = "2007")
basin_lu_metrics_07 <- site_merger(df = basin_lu_metrics_07, year = "2007")
phab_metrics_07_a <- site_merger(df = phab_metrics_07_a, year = "2007")
water_quality_07 <- site_merger(df = water_quality_07, year = "2007")

phab_litt_a <- phab_metrics_07_a %>%
  select(UNIQUE_ID, VISIT_NO, DATEPHAB, amfcAll)

chla_points <- chem_conditions_07 %>%
  select(LON_DD, LAT_DD, CHLA, UNIQUE_ID, VISIT_NO)

lat_long <- chla_points %>%
  select(LON_DD, LAT_DD, UNIQUE_ID)
```
	
 
	
##	Landcover Background and Analysis
	
	The dataset also possessed landuse metrics for the basin surrounding each lake. These metrics included basin area, percent cover for each type of land cover and area covered by each type of landcover. This data frame was cleaned so that a map could be created coloring each sample site by the dominant land cover in the basin as described by the Basin Landuse Metrics file and displayed in Figure 2 below. Landcover plays a significant role in the characteristics within a lake including the nutrient concentrations, the Chlorophyll A concentrations and the Littoral Macrophyte Density. 
	
	Creating DataFrame with Landcover assigned to each point
```{r 3-2}
nutrient_conc_07 <- water_quality_07 %>%
  filter(VISIT_NO == "1", SAMPLE_CATEGORY == "P") 

nutrient_conc_07 <- nutrient_conc_07 %>%
  select(UNIQUE_ID, DATE_COL, PTL, NTL, CHLA) %>%
  inner_join(lat_long, by = "UNIQUE_ID") %>%
  distinct()

nutrient_sf <- st_as_sf(nutrient_conc_07, coords = c("LON_DD", "LAT_DD"), crs = 4326)

pct_columns <- names(basin_lu_metrics_07)[grepl("PCT", names(basin_lu_metrics_07))]

landuse_join <- basin_lu_metrics_07 %>%
  select(UNIQUE_ID, pct_columns) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-UNIQUE_ID), names_to = "Landcover", values_to = "Percent")
```

  Because of the strong correlations between landcover and ecological properties, the sites were first examined for the dominant landcover in each respective watershed. A function as created that selected the landcover representing the highest percentage of coverage in each basin and the data was then mapped and each lake was colored by the dominant landcover. This preliminary analysis allowed for the visualization (Figure 2) of biogeochemical and ecological trends around the country. 
``` {r, 3-3.5}
landuse_long <- basin_lu_metrics_07 %>%
  select(UNIQUE_ID, pct_columns) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c(-UNIQUE_ID), names_to = "Landcover", values_to = "Percent") %>%
  group_by(UNIQUE_ID) %>%
  summarize_at("Percent", max)%>%
  ungroup()%>%
  left_join(landuse_join, by = c("UNIQUE_ID", "Percent"))

landuse_geom <- left_join(landuse_long, lat_long, by = "UNIQUE_ID")

landuse_sf <- st_as_sf(landuse_geom, coords = c("LON_DD", "LAT_DD"), crs = 4326)

qtm(landuse_sf, symbols.col = "Landcover", symbols.size = .1, title = "Figure 2 - Sites Colored by Dominant Landcover")
```
	
To identify spatial trends based on different metrics, landcover types and trophic statuses datasets were filtered in order to be best fit for analysis. These data frames were also joined with spatial characteristics so that they could be mapped.

```{r, 3-3}
phab_litt_geom1 <- left_join(phab_litt_a, lat_long, by = "UNIQUE_ID", multiple = "all") %>%
  distinct(.keep_all = TRUE) %>%
  filter(VISIT_NO == "1")

all_07 <- inner_join(nutrient_sf, phab_litt_geom1, by = "UNIQUE_ID") %>%
  select(UNIQUE_ID, PTL, NTL, CHLA, geometry, amfcAll)

clean_07 <- na.omit(all_07)

lu_07 <- inner_join(landuse_long, clean_07, by = "UNIQUE_ID")

## Adding Columns with log-based values
lu_07 <- lu_07 %>%
  mutate(log_CHLA = log10(CHLA),
         log_PTL = log10(PTL), 
         log_NTL = log10(NTL))

dominant_07 <- lu_07 %>%
  filter(Landcover == c("PCT_AGRIC_BSN", "PCT_FOREST_BSN", "PCT_DEVELOPED_BSN", "PCT_GRASS_BSN"))


lu_07_sf <- inner_join(lu_07, lat_long, by = "UNIQUE_ID")
lu_07_sf <- st_as_sf(lu_07_sf, coords = c("LON_DD", "LAT_DD"), crs = 4326)
```
 
 Creating Data Frames for Each Status of Lake
```{r}
oligo <- lu_07 %>%
  filter(CHLA <= 2)
meso <- lu_07 %>%
  filter(CHLA > 2 & CHLA <= 7)
eu <- lu_07 %>%
  filter(CHLA < 7 & CHLA <= 30)
heu <- lu_07 %>%
  filter(CHLA > 30)
```
