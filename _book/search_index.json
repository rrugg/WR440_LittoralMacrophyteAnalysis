While science has historically focused on the pelagic zone when looking to determine trophic status, the littoral zone and the plants there should not be ignored. This paper discusses different drivers of macrophyte coverage in the littoral zone through data analysis of data from 2007 from the National Lakes Assessment conducted by the EPA. This study examines the effect of dominant basin landcover, Chlorophyll A, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus and Trophic Status as determined by Chlorophyll A concentrations. No significant correlations were established which is an expected result for a study done at this spatial scale. "],["introduction.html", "Chapter 3 Introduction", " Chapter 3 Introduction The study of inland water quality has captivated scientists and the public alike as water scarcity, pollution and degradation have taken front page in newspapers around the world. Lake condition, referred to as Trophic Status (TS), is a common metric used by limnologists, researchers, and natural resource managers to communicate about the condition of lakes and to decide upon best management practices. Lakes are classified into one of several categories: most generally, oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic in increasing order of productivity. While productivity may seem like a positive ecological attribute, an excess of nutrients and organisms can lead to harmful conditions for wildlife and the surrounding ecosystem. This most often presents itself in the form of algal blooms, anoxic conditions and fish kills, but can also including cyanotoxins which are harmful to humans and animals alike. The most common parameters used to determine TS in lentic ecosystems are Total Phosphorus (TP), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Chlorophyll A (Chl A). Chlorophyll A is the mostly commonly examined metric for determining trophic status and is biologically connected to Phosphorus and Nitrogen concentrations in the water. These processes are critical to understanding ecosystem condition and best management practices. The heightened awareness of water quality around the world has driven scientists and natural resource managers to investigate other factors playing a role in shifts in trophic status. Led in part by an increased interest in lake greening, some limnologists have begun broadening the scope of their studies to include not only pelagic primary productivity but also the properties and patterns of the littoral zone. The understanding of the Littoral Zone and its relationship to Trophic Status, while growing, is still not well studied or understood and there is a lack of literature on the topic. The Littoral Zone is defined by the EPA as the nearshore area of a lake that extends from shore to the deepest point where submerged aquatic vegetation can be sustained or where the substrate receives one percent of light (US EPA, 2013). This area is often home to a wide variety of aquatic taxa. Macrophytes are “aquatic plants growing in or near water. They may be either emergent (i.e., with upright portions above the water surface), submerged or floating” (US EPA, 2013). The growth and density of these macrophytes are driven by a wide variety of biotic and abiotic factors and can be an indicator of lake health (Grzybowski et al., 2023). This same study discussed the stressor-response relationship that is often exhibited between ecological factors and littoral zone productivity response (Grzybowski et al., 2023). This study also investigated macrophyte species composition within several lakes worldwide and classified each lake based on the macrophyte taxonomy and other related characteristics. They, along with other studies, found that lakes that are clear and oligotrophic are often dominated in primary productivity by macrophyte biomass while turbid or eutrophic lakes often lose macrophyte biomass and are dominated by phytoplankton (Grzybowski et al., 2023; Scheffer et al., 2001; Scheffer &amp; van Nes, 2007). A study in eastern Europe examined correlations between lake macrophyte cover and the surrounding lake and landscape features. This study concluded that between 29 and 55 percent of the variation in littoral macrophyte coverage could be explained by the physio-chemical, hydrological and land use factors studied (Cheruvelil &amp; Soranno, 2008). Research has also concluded that lake nutrient concentrations typically decrease as Nitrogen and Phosphorus are taken up by littoral macrophytes and benthic algae, therefore nutrient concentrations should be examined along with littoral conditions in order to understand potential confounding variables (Grzybowski et al., 2023). Unfortunately, anthropogenic changes have also made a significant impact on the ability to predict and understand patterns of primary productivity in inland waters (Cheruvelil &amp; Soranno, 2008). Due to these confounding variables, primary productivity must be studied even more critically and with sensitivity to potential external impacts when the water body lies within a heavily influenced watershed. Only a few studies have taken samples and conducted analysis across a wide range of landscapes and physical characteristics. The figure below displays the lakes analyzed in the National Lakes Assessment, a widespread national survey of lake conditions and characteristics in 2007. The primary productivity of lakes is a critical ecological concept and significant portions of biogeochemistry, limnology, and aquatic ecology are dedicated to understanding where the dominant primary productivity is within the lake and what factors have caused it to be that way. The literature indicates that lakes with areas with submerged vegetation generally harbor a more diverse macroinvertebrate assemblage and higher animal biomass than vegetation- free areas (Hargeby et al., 1994). Other studies have found that phytoplankton biomass increases with increases in nutrient concentrations and decreases with submerged macrophyte coverage (Muylaert et al., 2010). With high concentrations of traditionally limiting nutrients (N and P), limitation and competition can shift away from Phosphorus and shift towards light causing competition between phytoplankton and littoral macrophytes (Portielje &amp; Van der Molen, 1999). Finally, some studies have indicated that landuse and landcover is one of the main determinants of macrophyte status (Grzybowski et al., 2023). Land use and land cover changes have been a significant challenge for ecosystem, wildlife and human health in the United States over the past several decades and understanding the relationship to macrophyte coverage is critical for improving management and scientific understanding.

These sites were chosen from the 2007 dataset to be analyzed for correlations between a variety of metrics and the fractional littoral macrophyte coverage present at the given lake. "],["methods.html", "Chapter 4 Methods 4.1 Landcover Background and Analysis", " Chapter 4 Methods Finding a comprehensive dataset that had consistent measurements of benthic or littoral conditions as well as nutrient data and a wide-spread spatial reach proved to be much more difficult than anticipated. The National Lakes Assessment dataset was selected for the data analysis included in this project. This dataset includes hundreds of metrics sampled at thousands of lakes around the United States in 2007, 2012 and 2017 including physical, chemical, and hydrological parameters. The data is all publicly available for download on their website and sampling methodologies are outlined for the convenience of the researcher. Zip files and CSV files were downloaded from the data portal and imported into R Studio for data analysis. A significant amount of time was spent data cleaning and formatting in order to prepare for statistical testing and visualization. Both learning and troubleshooting code for the entirety of this project were core to the success of the research and the understanding of the results.

The following four figures are the same as Figure 11 but are split out by the Trophic Status based on the criteria outlined in the methods section of this paper. Each of these figures describes the wide variety of traits possessed by inland waters in the United States and the difficulties scientists face when attempting large-scale analyses. One observation is the very low means present for LMC in the hypereutrophic lakes, indicating low Littoral Macrophyte Coverage in lakes with very high Chl A concentrations. Each of the four groups of trophic status then underwent a linear model to investigate the relationship between trophic status and primary productivity. Keep in mind that every R-Squared value represents the correlation between the predictor variable (nutrients and Chlorophyll A) and Fractional Littoral Macrophyte Coverage for the given trophic condition. o &lt;- ggplot(oligo, aes(x = log_CHLA, y = amfcAll))+ geom_point(col = &quot;cadetblue4&quot;)+ theme_few()+ labs(title = &quot;Oligotrophic&quot;) m &lt;- ggplot(meso, aes(x = log_CHLA, y = amfcAll))+ geom_point(col = &quot;cadetblue4&quot;)+ theme_few()+ labs(title = &quot;Mesotrophic&quot;) e &lt;- ggplot(eu, aes(x = log_CHLA, y = amfcAll))+ geom_point(col = &quot;cadetblue4&quot;)+ theme_few()+ labs(title = &quot;Eutrophic&quot;) h &lt;- ggplot(heu, aes(x = log_CHLA, y = amfcAll))+ geom_point(col = &quot;cadetblue4&quot;)+ theme_few()+ labs(title = &quot;Hypereutrophic&quot;) grid.arrange(o, m, e, h, ncol = 2) This final figure shows the distribution of primary productivity split out by trophic status. This indicates that there are some trends more localized to the trophic status of each lake but the statistical analysis still indicates that the correlations are very weak and do not indicate statistically significant findings. "],["discussion.html", "Chapter 7 Discussion", " Chapter 7 Discussion The statistical analysis indicates that there are very weak, if any correlations between the chosen predictor variables: landcover, trophic status, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus and Chlorophyll A and the Fractional Littoral Macrophyte Coverage in the respective lakes. While the correlations are all very weak (&lt;.22) the R-Squared values are larger for the linear models run to examine trends in trophic status compared to those run to examine trends in dominant landcover indicating that the trophic status of the lake may have a stronger relationship to the primary productivity in the lake than landcover. This conclusion is as expected based on the interconnected nature of trophic status and primary productivity in lakes. A few potential sources of error in these analyses include errors in the processing of the large dataset and possible inconsistencies in the sampling techniques used to collect the samples. The findings of this study are also limited by the scope of variables studied, only landcover, trophic status, nutrients and Chlorophyll A were examined in relation to Fractional Littoral Macrophyte Coverage. Many other variables have a significant influence on LMC and could either be a confounding variable or help to explain more of the variation in macrophyte coverage. One study indicated that secchi depth and mean lake depth were the most predictive variables for lake macrophyte coverage, but these variables were not within the scope of this study (Cheruvelil &amp; Soranno, 2008). Finally, no temporal scale was studied, all the data points analyzed were gathered in 2007. Some additional scientific findings indicate that littoral macrophyte coverage may be a long-term indicator of trophic status, but no temporal variation was examined within this study (Eigemann et al., 2016). This analysis just barely scratches the surface of the complex relationships between different aquatic ecological principles and concepts. There is a great need for more assessments like the National Lakes Assessment and continuation of these studies over time to help provide researchers and natural resource managers with the information they need to classify lakes and manage their treatment. Further study could also be useful in the context of littoral macrophytes as a mechanism for uptake of nutrients in systems with varying trophic status and dominant landcover. Variables such as taxonomy, land use and land cover change in the basin, water temperature, sediment inputs and so much more could be useful to pair with a study like this one to better understand the relationships between these complex variables and their effect on the natural environment. In conclusion, while some trends and weak correlations were found between different variables, none of the variables chosen were able to explain more than 20 percent of the variation in the Fractional Littoral Macrophyte Coverage in the studied lakes. Understanding ecological processes in the littoral zone is critical for broadening scientific understanding in aiding in complex natural resource management decisions and further study of these topics is critical.
