Lake condition, referred to as Trophic Status (TS), is a common metric used by limnologists, researchers, and natural resource managers to communicate about the condition of lakes and to decide upon best management practices. Lakes are classified into one of several categories: most generally, oligotrophic, mesotrophic and eutrophic in increasing order of productivity. While productivity may seem like a positive ecological attribute, an excess of nutrients and organisms can lead to harmful conditions for wildlife and the surrounding ecosystem. This most often presents itself in the form of algal blooms, anoxic conditions and fish kills, but can also including cyanotoxins which are harmful to humans and animals alike. The most common parameters used to determine TS in lentic ecosystems are Total Phosphorus (TP), Total Nitrogen (TN), and Chlorophyll A (Chl A). Chlorophyll A is the mostly commonly examined metric for determining trophic status and is biologically connected to Phosphorus and Nitrogen concentrations in the water. These processes are critical to understanding ecosystem condition and best management practices. The heightened awareness of water quality around the world has driven scientists and natural resource managers to investigate other factors playing a role in shifts in trophic status. Led in part by an increased interest in lake greening, some limnologists have begun broadening the scope of their studies to include not only pelagic primary productivity but also the properties and patterns of the littoral zone. The understanding of the Littoral Zone and its relationship to Trophic Status, while growing, is still not well studied or understood and there is a lack of literature on the topic. The Littoral Zone is defined by the EPA as the nearshore area of a lake that extends from shore to the deepest point where submerged aquatic vegetation can be sustained or where the substrate receives one percent of light (US EPA, 2013). This area is often home to a wide variety of aquatic taxa. Macrophytes are “aquatic plants growing in or near water. They may be either emergent (i.e., with upright portions above the water surface), submerged or floating” (US EPA, 2013). The growth and density of these macrophytes are driven by a wide variety of biotic and abiotic factors and can be an indicator of lake health (Grzybowski et al., 2023). This same study discussed the stressor-response relationship that is often exhibited between ecological factors and littoral zone productivity response (Grzybowski et al., 2023). This study also investigated macrophyte species composition within several lakes worldwide and classified each lake based on the macrophyte taxonomy and other related characteristics. They, along with other studies, found that lakes that are clear and oligotrophic are often dominated in primary productivity by macrophyte biomass while turbid or eutrophic lakes often lose macrophyte biomass and are dominated by phytoplankton (Grzybowski et al., 2023; Scheffer et al., 2001; Scheffer &amp; van Nes, 2007). A study in eastern Europe examined correlations between lake macrophyte cover and the surrounding lake and landscape features. This study concluded that between 29 and 55 percent of the variation in littoral macrophyte coverage could be explained by the physio-chemical, hydrological and land use factors studied (Cheruvelil &amp; Soranno, 2008). Research has also concluded that lake nutrient concentrations typically decrease as Nitrogen and Phosphorus are taken up by littoral macrophytes and benthic algae, therefore nutrient concentrations should be examined along with littoral conditions in order to understand potential confounding variables (Grzybowski et al., 2023). Unfortunately, anthropogenic changes have also made a significant impact on the ability to predict and understand patterns of primary productivity in inland waters (Cheruvelil &amp; Soranno, 2008). Due to these confounding variables, primary productivity must be studied even more critically and with sensitivity to potential external impacts when the water body lies within a heavily influenced watershed. Only a few studies have taken samples and conducted analysis across a wide range of landscapes and physical characteristics. The figure below displays the lakes analyzed in the National Lakes Assessment, a widespread national survey of lake conditions and characteristics in 2007. The primary productivity of lakes is a critical ecological concept and significant portions of biogeochemistry, limnology, and aquatic ecology are dedicated to understanding where the dominant primary productivity is within the lake and what factors have caused it to be that way. The literature indicates that lakes with areas with submerged vegetation generally harbor a more diverse macroinvertebrate assemblage and higher animal biomass than vegetation- free areas (Hargeby et al., 1994). Other studies have found that phytoplankton biomass increases with increases in nutrient concentrations and decreases with submerged macrophyte coverage (Muylaert et al., 2010). With high concentrations of traditionally limiting nutrients (N and P), limitation and competition can shift away from Phosphorus and shift towards light causing competition between phytoplankton and littoral macrophytes (Portielje &amp; Van der Molen, 1999). Finally, some studies have indicated that landuse and landcover is one of the main determinants of macrophyte status (Grzybowski et al., 2023). Land use and land cover changes have been a significant challenge for ecosystem, wildlife and human health in the United States over the past several decades and understanding the relationship to macrophyte coverage is critical for improving management and scientific understanding. A Map of All Site in the NLA Dataset for 2007 qtm(clean_07, symbols.size = 0.3, symbols.col = &quot;cadetblue4&quot;, title = &quot;All NLA Sites 2007&quot;) The above sites are representative of widely diverse ecological characteristics and human influenced landscapes. These sites were chosen from the 2007 dataset to be analyzed for correlations between a variety of metrics and the fractional littoral macrophyte coverage present at the given lake. "],["methods.html", "Chapter 4 Methods 4.1 Landcover Background and Analysis", " Chapter 4 Methods Finding a comprehensive dataset that had consistent measurements of benthic or littoral conditions as well as nutrient data and a wide-spread spatial reach proved to be much more difficult than anticipated. The National Lakes Assessment dataset was selected for the data analysis included in this project. This dataset includes hundreds of metrics sampled at thousands of lakes around the United States in 2007, 2012 and 2017 including physical, chemical, and hydrological parameters. The data is all publicly available for download on their website and sampling methodologies are outlined for the convenience of the researcher. Zip files and CSV files were downloaded from the data portal and imported into R Studio for data analysis. A significant amount of time was spent data cleaning and formatting in order to prepare for statistical testing and visualization. Both learning and troubleshooting code for the entirety of this project were core to the success of the research and the understanding of the results.

These metrics included basin area, percent cover for each type of land cover and area covered by each type of landcover. This data frame was cleaned so that a map could be created coloring each sample site by the dominant land cover in the basin as described by the Basin Landuse Metrics file and displayed in Figure 2 below.

This project investigates the relationship between key predictor variables for primary productivity and the relationship between pelagic-dominated productivity and littoral-dominated productivity. A few potential sources of error in these analysis include potentially inconsistent sampling metrics across the very wide spatial scope of the National Lakes Assessment A few potential sources of error in these analyses include complex and inconsistent raw datasets, sampling, and reporting techniques. The sample size included in the data analysis in this project only included the 142 sites that were classified as eutrophic in 2007 and where data was also available for the same sites in 2012 and 2017. In addition to these sources of error, there is some controversy surrounding how Trophic Status should be determined and I used general metrics outlined by the EPA in their NLA dataset to classify lakes as Eutrophic based on NTL, PTL or CHLA (PTL &gt;= 25 | NTL &gt;= 750 | CHLA &gt;= 7) UNITS. The temporal limitations of this study were an additional challenge to the reliability of the results; only three years of data were available from the EPA through the NLA. If additional years of data are added to this program at some point, comparison of the trends in relationship to the new data would be required ot support the findings of this study. Finally, there are countless other variables that affect the growth patterns of littoral macrophytes and there could be some unexamined or unsampled parameters that had an outside effect on these variables and that indicated correlation when, in reality, there were other confounding variables. None of these variables should be used on their own to predict the trends of other variables. The ecology of aquatic systems is incredibly complex and a large spatial, temporal, and ecological study should be done in order to make any management decisions about lakes or their surrounding ecosystems. It is also important to study the species that present in these aquatic systems and to investigate if there is a correlation or relationship specific to the species of macrophyte present in the system. The analysis indicates that there may be a delayed response in the fractional macrophyte coverage compared to nutrient loading in the system. OTHER RESULTS AND CLAIMS HERE This analysis just barely scratches the surface of the complex relationships between different aquatic ecological principles and concepts. There is a great need for more assessments like the National Lakes Assessment and continuation of these studies over time to help provide researchers and natural resource managers with the information they need to classify lakes and manage their treatment. Further study could also be useful in the context of littoral macrophytes as a mechanism for uptake of excess nutrients in aquatic systems. While it is hard to prove causation in any large-scale study like this one, if the N and P inputs into the system were known, along with the existing concentrations of N and P, then change in nutrient levels could be measured against changes in littoral macrophyte cover to explore ecological solutions to significant challenges like eutrophication. Variables such as taxonomy, land use and land cover change in the basin, water temperature, sediment inputs and so much more could be useful to pair with a study like this one to better understand the relationships between these complex variables and their effect on the natural environment. In conclusion, this research helps to support the claims of Eigemann et al., 2016 that littoral macrophyte coverage could be a good indicator of long-term ecological health as well as sheds light on the interconnectivity of different ecological variables over time. Despite a lack of correlation for a given year between nutrient concentrations and amfcAll, when spread over a ten year period, the possible correlation became evident. This warrants further investigation with a larger dataset, a greater number of variables and most importantly a larger temporal scale. The gained understanding of trophic status can help scientists and natural resource managers better trigger mitigation efforts as well as improve communication surrounding the status of lentic water bodies. Finally, this study could help shed some light on the source scientific disagreement surrounding trophic trends of lakes worldwide.
