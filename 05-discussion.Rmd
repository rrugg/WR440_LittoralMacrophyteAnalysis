# Discussion

The statistical analysis indicates that there are very weak, if any correlations between the chosen predictor variables: landcover, trophic status, Total Nitrogen, Total Phosphorus and Chlorophyll A and the Fractional Littoral Macrophyte Coverage in the respective lakes. While the correlations are all very weak (<.22) the R-Squared values are larger for the linear models run to examine trends in trophic status compared to those run to examine trends in dominant landcover indicating that the trophic status of the lake may have a stronger relationship to the primary productivity in the lake than landcover. This conclusion is as expected based on the interconnected nature of trophic status and primary productivity in lakes. 
	A few potential sources of error in these analyses include errors in the processing of the large dataset and possible inconsistencies in the sampling techniques used to collect the samples. The findings of this study are also limited by the scope of variables studied, only landcover, trophic status, nutrients and Chlorophyll A were examined in relation to Fractional Littoral Macrophyte Coverage. Many other variables have a significant influence on LMC and could either be a confounding variable or help to explain more of the variation in macrophyte coverage. One study indicated that secchi depth and mean lake depth were the most predictive variables for lake macrophyte coverage, but these variables were not within the scope of this study (Cheruvelil & Soranno, 2008). Finally, no temporal scale was studied, all the data points analyzed were gathered in 2007. Some additional scientific findings indicate that littoral macrophyte coverage may be a long-term indicator of trophic status, but no temporal variation was examined within this study (Eigemann et al., 2016).  
	This analysis just barely scratches the surface of the complex relationships between different aquatic ecological principles and concepts. There is a great need for more assessments like the National Lakes Assessment and continuation of these studies over time to help provide researchers and natural resource managers with the information they need to classify lakes and manage their treatment. Further study could also be useful in the context of littoral macrophytes as a mechanism for uptake of nutrients in systems with varying trophic status and dominant landcover. Variables such as taxonomy, land use and land cover change in the basin, water temperature, sediment inputs and so much more could be useful to pair with a study like this one to better understand the relationships between these complex variables and their effect on the natural environment. 
	In conclusion, while some trends and weak correlations were found between different variables, none of the variables chosen were able to explain more than 20 percent of the variation in the Fractional Littoral Macrophyte Coverage in the studied lakes. Understanding ecological processes in the littoral zone is critical for broadening scientific understanding in aiding in complex natural resource management decisions and further study of these topics is critical.
